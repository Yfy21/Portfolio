# Data Analysis and Science Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Analysis and Science Portfolio! The goal of this repository is to showcase a collection of projects and code snippets that demonstrate the essential tasks and skills required in the daily work of a data analyst and data scientist. The projects here will cover a wide range of topics, including data cleaning, exploration, visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning.

Whether you're a potential employer or a fellow data enthusiast, feel free to explore the code, review the documentation, and see how I approach solving real-world data problems.
