In this project, the goal was to create a regression model to predict the number of days a customer rents DVDs for with a mean squared error (MSE) of less than 3.0.

After trying to approach the dataset in many complex ways (scaling the data, separating squared variables from non-squared ones, and creating dummy variables for each label in the "special features" column), I found out that the simplest approach yielded the best result.
What I take from this is that, sometimes, the simplest solution is the best one, since the majority of consequences result from a minority of causes (Pareto's Principle) and we don't always have much time at our disposal.
