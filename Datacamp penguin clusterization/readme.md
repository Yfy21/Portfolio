This project is part of Datacamp's Data Scientist with Python Career Track and requires students to employ preprocessing and clustering techniques to group observations from a real dataset into three different penguins species.
Even though the project didn't ask for visuals, I thought that a scatter matrix would help to visualize the differences between the species.
